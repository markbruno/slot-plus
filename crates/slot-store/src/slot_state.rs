/// It stops at six because eight was measured and bought nothing. On mGBA gameplay a ceiling of
/// eight ran 281 game frames a second against six's 280, while presents that ran past 16.67 ms
/// went from 1% to 7% and the loop started a frame it could not finish in 56% of presents
/// rather than 19%. On the heaviest content it changed nothing at all: Pokémon under mGBA held
/// 2.1 frames a present at four, six and eight alike. A row should not offer a ceiling only one
/// core can reach.
///
/// What an older build does with the number six, said plainly rather than left to be found out:
/// every slot that shipped before this row reads this line as "a number from 2 to 4, anything
/// else is not mine", so a card written here at 6 falls back to that build's default, 4×, when
/// read by it. That is acceptable — 4× was the fastest speed it had, so it is as close to what
/// was asked as that build can get, and neither build ever finds a speed it cannot explain. A
/// card written at 8 by a build from the night this row had five ceilings falls back the same
/// way, through the same list, exactly as the 255 an adaptive-era card can still hold. The cost,
/// accepted: an older build that goes on to *write* the card spells 4 here, so a round trip
/// through one forgets the choice.

/// as six on mGBA gameplay, no speed at all on heavy content, and less steady on both. Six is
/// the one that reads as fast without feeling like a different game, and it is a ceiling both
/// cores can actually reach. The old default of 4x was inherited from when gpSP ran its
/// interpreter and could not serve more; the core slot builds now runs its dynarec, so 4x had
/// stopped being what the hardware could do and become merely what it was told.
///
/// This deliberately sits outside the 2..=4 an older build accepts, which the default used to
/// stay inside so the common card read identically everywhere. A fresh card written here reads
/// as 4x on any build that predates this row — the same fallback 6x takes as a choice.
